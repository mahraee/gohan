Keep cooking (do not flip) until these bubbles dry out (about 2 minutes). If no bubbles are appearing, you might need to add a little bit of more water as your batter is probably too thick.\nWhen the bubbles dry out completely and are no longer shiny, it means that the atayef are done. Remove them from pan immediately, and repeat the process until you finish up the batter.\nTransfer the atayef to a tea towel and cover very well so that they don't dry out (otherwise they will start breaking when you try to fold/seal them).\nStuff the Atayef with the filling of your choice (cheese, cinnamon walnuts, or almonds) then either deep fry them, or brush them with oil and bake until they're golden and crispy. Dip in sugar syrup or just drizzle with it (for best results, soak warm Atayef in cold syrup)."),
